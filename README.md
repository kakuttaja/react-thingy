# react-thingy
Built with the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) thing via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to commit and deploy to GitHub. Or something like that. I think.
## TL;DR
I've got no clue what I'm doing, nor why I'm doing it. Don't take any example of this, except for any (unlikely) stuff that may accidentally be functional. Oh right, this was for a Uni course. Kind of. Partially.
Well, at least to a degree, I suppose.
